Hi everyone!

I'm a 27 year-old from Gothenburg who's attending a web developer program at Linneaus University in Sweden.
I'm employed at a research project of Gothenburg University, and aiming at becoming a developer as a side-project, which 
though is groing to be my main project. I'm intrigued by the 'computers world' and have learned so much already, 
though it's all new and sometimes kinda tough to learn fully.. But I'll get to the end of the rainbow in a short while!

In addition I enjoy Seinfeld, Chet Baker and marzipan.
