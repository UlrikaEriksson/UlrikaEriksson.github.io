As a non-frequent-blogger I'll do my best. How about a recap of my day? Well alright, if you insist.

So my fiancé is out of town for a week, which means the dishes are growing into Mount Everest. I would benefit of a visit
to motivate me to clear things up at home. But I get other more important things done, such as calling numerous of study
participants in the project of Sahlgrenska I'm involved in. Kinda pleasant cause I only get to speak to 85 year-olds, which
is super nice in so many ways.

Managed to get two episodes of Seinfeld into my schedule, you don't need much more to have your smile of the day.

Waiting for my fiancé to give me a call for a apartment-thingy we have going on in Stockholm. So soon enough: bye bye Gothenburg.
I'll miss you LOADS!
