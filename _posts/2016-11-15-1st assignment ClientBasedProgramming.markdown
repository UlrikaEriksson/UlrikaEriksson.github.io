### 1. What do you think of pre-compiling your CSS?

>When you get the hang of it, the structure becomes more organized and shortened in the long run, which both
>limits the chance for errors and lets you alter code more efficient. It also offers developers to use e.g. variables, functions
> in css-purpose.

### 2. What do you think of static site generators?

> Great for reducing the time it takes to duplicate your web site's different, almost identical, html- files. This in my opinion makes
> developing more efficient and organized. In addition, it shortens loading time for the client and has a high security level. Apart from the below mentioned
> limitations, I'd say my experience is similar to pre-processors.

### 3. What type of projects are they suitable for?

> Projects with a larger amount of complex content, such as extensive databases, should not work with static site generators.
> Rather, a static site is more suitable for less "dynamic" sites with information and/or presentations.

### 4. What is robots.txt and how have you configure it for your site?

> robots.txt-files are used to give instructions to web robots on what access robots or specific robots have on your web site.
> Robots scan web sites for content, which can vary depending on the robot's goal. For example both search engines and spammers use them.
> robot-txt:s are also called Robots Exclusion Protocols. For now, I've allowed full access to all robots on this web site
> to broaden accessibility, and due to the fact that "badbots" often ignore robots.txt- files anyway.

### 5. What is humans.txt and how have you configure it for your site?

> humans.txt is an easy way to give access to information about the web site's authors/teams/developing software and more.
> Such information could quite quickly fill up space on the web site that could be more suitable for other content. I configured my
> humans.txt with information about the creator, special thanks to the course team, and when the site was lastly updated.

### 6. How did you implements comments to blog posts?

> Through the usage of [Disqus](https://disqus.com/), i.e. by creating a disqus.html- file with the disqus universal code, place this in  the _includes - folder,
> include this file in the layout for posts and finally put "comments: true" in the desired post md- file.

### 7. What is Open Graph and how do you make use of it?
